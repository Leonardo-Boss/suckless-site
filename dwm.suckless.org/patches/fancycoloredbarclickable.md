# fancycoloredbarclickable

## Description

This patch provides colors in the status area, shows the titles of all
visible Clients and provides a function to select a client by clicking
on its title.
Actually this patch combines the fancybar Patch and the statuscolors Patch
with the additional selectby-click-on-title function.
The fancybar patch used is rather new and unchanged, while the statuscolor
patch is older and modified. The original statuscolor patch made gaps after
changing the color and used its own color definition everywhere. This
modified version made no gaps and the default color definition is used
everywhere but in the status area.
