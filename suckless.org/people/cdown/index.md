==========

I like to write minimalist software. I've written some patches for dwm and some
stuff for dmenu, although I'm not as active in the community as I used to be.

- [alwaysfullscreen](//dwm.suckless.org/patches/alwaysfullscreen)
- [attachaside (unfocused tag version)](//dwm.suckless.org/patches/attachaside)
- [center](//dwm.suckless.org/patches/center)
- [ispermanent](//dwm.suckless.org/patches/ispermanent)
- [killunsel](//dwm.suckless.org/patches/killunsel)

Most of my projects are hosted on [my Github](https://github.com/cdown), or on
[my website](https://chrisdown.name).
