Ignore Transient Windows
========================

Description
-----------
This fix issues working with Jetbrains applications and the UE4 Editor.

Also, not sure if needed but add the following for some java applications before launching dwm:

export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1
export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit
wmname LG3D
