nostatusbar
===========

Description
-----------
Remove statusbar and all related code from dwm (more than 500 lines).
dwm is already very slim. But if you do not use the built-in statusbar
this patch will make it even more minimal and efficient.

If you find any code which I forgot to remove feel free to contact me
and/or upload an updated version of this patch.
