wmi was the initial project which became popular, though [wmii](http://wmii.suckless.org) is the
successor of wmi. The last release of wmi happened back in 2004. There are still
some occasional users of wmi. If you would like to experience the good old days,
please check it out; though, its code sucks more unfortunately than our recent projects.

*UPDATE* There will be a wmi-11 release in Sep 2009 very soon!

Download
--------
You can download an historic copy of
[wmi-10](http://dl.suckless.org/misc/wmi-10.tar.gz). You can also [browse](http://hg.suckless.org/wmi) its source code repository or get a copy using [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) with the following command:

	hg clone http://hg.suckless.org/wmi

(The repository contains the source code of the upcoming wmi-11 release!!!)

Build
-----
In order to build wmi-10 on more recent systems than they were back 4
years ago, you will need to apply [this
patch](wmi-10_compile_fixes.diff) by Sergey Dolgov.

The upcoming wmi-11 version from the source repository just builds fine with current systems.

Issues
------
If you want to contact the author of wmi, use his proper email address
[garbeam@gmail.com](mailto:garbeam@gmail.com) -- the email address presented in
the wmi-10 source isn't valid anymore. Though that's fixed in the upcoming wmi-11 release.

Have fun!
