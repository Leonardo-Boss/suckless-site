cyclelayouts
============

Description
-----------
Cycles through all avaiable layouts using MOD-CTRL-, and MOD-CTRL-.

This adds a "NULL, NULL" layout at the end of the list, which should always be
the last layout in your list.

This is probably only "useful" if you are using a lot of layouts.

Inspired by [this post](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=103402).

Hopefully whoever wanted this sees it and no longer has to duplicate functions.
