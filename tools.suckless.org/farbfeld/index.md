farbfeld is a lossless image format which is easy to parse, pipe and
compress.
It has the following format:

| Bytes  | Description                                             |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 8      | "farbfeld" magic value                                  |
| 4      | 32-Bit BE unsigned integer (width)                      |
| 4      | 32-Bit BE unsigned integer (height)                     |
| [2222] | 4â‹…16-Bit BE unsigned integers [RGBA] / pixel, row-major |

The RGB-data should be sRGB for best interoperability and not
alpha-premultiplied.

Examples
--------

Convert image.png to a farbfeld, run it through a filter and write the
result to image-filtered.png:

        $ png2ff < image.png | filter | ff2png > image-filtered.png

[invert.c](invert.c) is an example for such a filter which inverts
the colors. Notice that there are no dependencies on external libraries.
A hypothetical farbfeld-library would hardly exceed invert.c's size.


Store a png as a compressed farbfeld:

        $ png2ff < image.png | bzip2 > image.ff.bz2

Access a compressed farbfeld as a png:

        $ bunzip2 < image.ff.bz2 | ff2png {> image.png, | feh -, ...}

Handle arbitrary image data using 2ff(1), which falls
back to imagemagick's convert(1) for unknown image types:

        $ 2ff < image | filter | ff2png > image-filtered.png

Refer to the manpages for more information. farbfeld(5) is a good start.

FAQ
---

### Why yet another image format?

Current image formats have integrated compression,
making it complicated to read the image data.
One is forced to use complex libraries like libpng,
libjpeg, libjpeg-turbo, giflib and others, read the
documentation and write a lot of boilerplate in order
to get started.

Farbfeld leaves this behind and is designed to be as
simple as possible, leaving the task of compression
to external tools.
The simple design, which was the primary objective,
implicitly leads to the very good compression
characteristics, as it often happens when you go with
the UNIX philosophy.
Reading farbfeld images doesn't require any special
libraries. The tools are just a toolbox
to make it easy to convert between common image formats
and farbfeld.

### How does it work?

In Farbfeld, pattern resolution is not done while
converting, but while compressing the image.
For example, farbfeld always stores the alpha-channel,
even if the image doesn't have alpha-variation.
This may sound like a big waste at first, but as
soon as you compress an image of this kind, the
compression-algorithm (e.g. bz2) recognizes the
pattern that every 48 bits the 16 bits store the
same information.
And the compression-algorithms get better and better
at this.

Same applies to the idea of having 16 bits per channel.
It sounds excessive, but if you for instance only have
a greyscale image, the R, G and B channels will store
the same value, which is recognized by the compression
algorithm easily.

This effectively leads to filesizes you'd normally only
reach with paletted images, and in some cases bz2 even
beats png's compression, for instance when you're dealing
with grayscale data, line drawings, decals and even
photographs.

### Why use 16-Bits-per-channel all the time? Isn't this a total waste?

Not when you take compression into account. To make this
clearer, assume a paletted image with 5 colors and no
transparency. So the data is only a set of regular chunks
(color1, ..., color5) in a certain order.
Compression algorithms have been designed to recognize those
chunks and can even look at how these chunks interact.

Local tests have shown that farbfeld easily beats paletted
PNG-images. Try for yourself and look at the bzipped results!
There is no need for special grayscale, palette, RGB, 1-, 2-,
4-, 8-, 16-Bit subformats.
Just use 16-Bit RGBA all the time and let compression take
care of the rest.

### Which compression should I use?

bzip2 is recommended, which is widely available (anybody has it)
and gives good results. As time will move forward and new
algorithms hit the market, this recommendation might be rethought.

### What about NetPBM?

NetPBM is considered to be the most simple format around,
however, there's much room for improvement.
In fact, it doesn't help that the format is subdivided into
Portable BitMaps, Portable GrayMaps and Portable PixMaps.
It's not helpful when a manpage can't give a simple overview
of a format in a few sentences.

NetPBM's big vice is that it has originally been developed
to be hand-written and passed around as plain text. A binary
format exists, but still handling optional comments
in the header, base 10 ASCII width and height values,
arbitrary whitespace inside the data and out-of-band
image size and color depth is too painful for the sane user.

Judging from the usage of the format considering how long
it's been around, it's no surprise it never really took off.
Additionally, functionality like alpha channels and 16-Bit
color depth can only be achieved via extensions.
Due to it being a textual format it also lacks the desired
compression characteristics.

The question you have to ask yourself is: Can I read in a
format without consulting the manpages? If your answer is
yes, then the format is simple enough.
In this regard, NetPBM can be considered to be a failed format.
