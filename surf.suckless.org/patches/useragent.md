USER AGENT
==========

Description
-----------

This patch adds the _SURF_AGENT xproperty which allows updating surf's useragent
while running. It may be useful to have a file of predefined useragents to pipe
through dmenu, or to have a script user xprop and set it for you.

The patch is currently for hg tip (changeset 2998ef786732).  Once the next
release comes out I'll keep it in sync with releases.
