I haven't been part of suckless from 2016-09-28. After problems in
suckless have been resolved, I am back, maintaining dwmstatus at the
moment.

I was the maintainer of st, surf, tabbed and more projects at suckless.

For personal projects I work on see my [repositories](gopher://r-36.net/1/scm).

At Bitreich I keep developing the suckless philosophy further into other
directions, including to other protocols, different aspects of culture
and more projects.
