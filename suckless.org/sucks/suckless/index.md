The Suckless Community
=============================

All they do is whine about stuff they don't like

Their software "alternatives" are completely unusable in any pragmatic sense.

they don't like GUIs, they don't like modern programming languages, and
they're joining a community near you to spend 5 hours a day whining about it.

Try joining [the mailing list](https://suckless.org/community/),
it's a neverending series of complaints about how buggy and broken their software is.

As much as they tout the portability and usability of their hyper-minimal C programs,
they're riddled with bugs and they don't actually maintain them so any usable form of them requires
"patches" inserted in the source code by the end user.

This means, of course that any binary distribution is out of the question. You have to compile it yourself.

These are the people who join support groups and tell new users to "RTFM",
the same unreadable manpages they bitch about in
[sucks, under Documentation](https://suckless.org/sucks/)

They'd send newb ubuntu users to lmgtfy, but it probably doesn't load in [their favorite browser.](https://surf.suckless.org/)

They ultimately harm the free software world far more than they help it by bashing every good thing the free software world
has created.

They especially hate [SystemD](https://suckless.org/sucks/systemd/) to the point of derangement,
going so far as to contradict themselves multiple times in a desparate attempt to make any legitimate criticism.

Most of the claims suckless makes are pure FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) designed to garner attention to their C
( **C**omplaining) cult.

Do yourself a favor and kick your local suckless member in the balls.
