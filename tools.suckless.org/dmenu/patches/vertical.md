VERTICAL MENU
=============

This patch allows you to present a vertical menu instead of a horizontal (this is especially useful for long menu entries such as URLs in conjunction with surf).

It is expected this patch will go into mainstream dmenu in a slightly modified form in the next version (due to the recent decision of surf to use dmenu for interactive input).

***Note, this patch is being accepted for mainstream dmenu and in hg tip.***
