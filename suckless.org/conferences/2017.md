suckless hackathon 2017, Würzburg, Germany
==========================================

slcon hackathon 2017 will be held in Würzburg on 2017-09-(01-03).

If you want to firmly attend, please send a mail to

* [chairs@suckless.org](mailto:chairs@suckless.org)

by *2017-06-15*.

In contrast to previous years we won't conduct regular talk sessions
this year and hence are not(!) calling for talk proposals.

Instead we want to be able to spend as much time as possible on
hacking during the event.
The nature of the event will be more like a hacker camp than a tech
conference this year.

More details will be released in July.
