### (13:00-18:00) Talk sessions

#### Machine Translation, Manu Raster

The topic I would like to present is "Machine Translation" and it is in
the spirit of Douglas Hofstadters destructive critique¹ and my own
critique of Franz-Josef Ochs² concepts of translation from a history of
science point of view. In comparison to the early beginnings (Bar-Hillel
1960 "The Present Status of Automatic Translation of Languages") little
progress has been made. In particular I will explain

- why engineers use intermediate languages (IL) and why they suck
  - analogies between code generation and literature translation
  - keywords: philologists and barbarians, the babelfish-device, binary-size sanity
- how translation fails on IL-level and surface level (destination language)
- what a good computer assisted translation tool for advanced users can
  achieve such as an Acme-based tool³

and present reproducable examples where Google Translate™ and its
epigones fail systematically.

#### The Static Web, Laslo Hunhold

A presentation of the concept of the 'static web', an approach to web
development using static websites and special approaches to data integration.

#### Acme saved my life, Marc Chantreux

Acme is the editor of choice in plan9. I don't use it but when trying
it, I realized that vim is much more than an editor: it's an open window
to my whole digital world: A perfect multipurpose UI. Let me show you ...
