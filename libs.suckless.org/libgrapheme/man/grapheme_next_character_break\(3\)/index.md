	GRAPHEME_NEXT_CHARACTER_BREAK(3)		      Library Functions Manual
	
	NAME
	     grapheme_next_character_break â€“ determine codepoint-offset to next
	     grapheme cluster break
	
	SYNOPSIS
	     #include <grapheme.h>
	
	     size_t
	     grapheme_next_character_break(const uint_least32_t *str, size_t len);
	
	DESCRIPTION
	     The grapheme_next_character_break() function computes the offset (in
	     codepoints) to the next grapheme cluster break (see libgrapheme(7)) in
	     the codepoint array str of length len.  If a grapheme cluster begins at
	     str this offset is equal to the length of said grapheme cluster.
	
	     If len is set to SIZE_MAX (stdint.h is already included by grapheme.h)
	     the string str is interpreted to be NUL-terminated and processing stops
	     when a codepoint with the value 0 is encountered.
	
	     For UTF-8-encoded input data grapheme_next_character_break_utf8(3) can be
	     used instead.
	
	RETURN VALUES
	     The grapheme_next_character_break() function returns the offset (in
	     codepoints) to the next grapheme cluster break in str or 0 if str is
	     NULL.

	STANDARDS
	     grapheme_next_character_break() is compliant with the Unicode 15.0.0
	     specification.
