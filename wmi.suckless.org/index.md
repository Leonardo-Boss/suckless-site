wmi was the initial project which became popular, though [wmii](http://wmii.suckless.org) is the
successor of wmi. The last release of wmi happened back in 2004. There are still
some occasional users of wmi. If you would like to experience the good old days,
please check it out; though, its code sucks more unfortunately than our recent projects.
