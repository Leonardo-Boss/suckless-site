Squares
=======

Description
-----------
Instead of changing the color of the entire screen to indicate the current lock
state, draw centered squares on each monitor and change the square colors.

This patch requires xrandr to be active and otherwise defaults to the original
slock behavior.

Use `squaresize` in `config.def.h` to set the size of the square (in px).
