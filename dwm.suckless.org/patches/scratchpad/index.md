scratchpad
==========

Description
-----------
The scratchpad patch allows you to spawn or restore a floating terminal window.
It is usually useful to have one to do some short typing.

A tool like detach (http://detach.sourceforge.net) turns it into a launchpad
for X applications.

By default your terminal (st) is used, and the default key binding is
`MODKEY+XK_grave`. A `config.def.h` change is included in the patch.
