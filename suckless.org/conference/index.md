Proposals
---------
We expect talk proposals between 30-60 minutes each covering either
technical or philosophical topics (rants are welcome as well).

Each proposal should contain
* the name of the author
* an abstract written in English
* presumably a couple of reference links to related ideas or topics

Please note, do only submit a proposal if you are pretty certain that
you can attend the conference on the given date.

Please submit your proposal to: con(at)suckless.org

We don't expect a paper or slide set prior to the conference! Your
proposal should enable us to accept/deny your talk and to schedule an
adequate slot for it.

If you cannot attend on a certain day, please add a note to your
proposal. We then are able to fine-tune the schedule.

Acceptance and final schedule presentation

We expect to publish the accepted talks and schedule around early August 2016.
