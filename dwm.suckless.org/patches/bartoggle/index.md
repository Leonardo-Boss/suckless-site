bartoggle
=========

Description
-----------
This patch allows you to toggle every part of the dwm bar with keybinds. In addition to showbar, this patch adds:

* `showtitle` - Whether or not to show the title
* `showtags` - Whether or not to show the tags
* `showlayout` - Whether or not to show the layout indicator
* `showstatus` - Whether or not to show the status bar
* `showfloating` - Whether or not to show the floating indicator

If you opt for the keybinds version, it also adds keybinds that can be used to toggle these options during runtime. This patch is maintained on its codeberg repository [here](https://codeberg.org/speedie/patches).
