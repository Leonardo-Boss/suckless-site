====================

Talks
-----

(10:30-10:45) *The latest developments*, Anselm R Garbe

Anselm will also charge the conference fees (presumably we can provide invoices
as foundation on this day already)

(10:45-11:00) Coffee/tea break

(11:00-11:30) *dvtm - dynamic virtual terminal manager*, Marc Andr√© Tanner

(11:30-12:00) *Simple Jabber - Divide And Conquer XMPP*, Jan Klemkow

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)1 is like the web. It is
far too complex to be implemented in one program with the Unix philosophy in mind.
But like the web, you have to deal with it. It is the only open
and widely used instant messaging protocol on the internet.
Its extensibility is the main reason that an implementation in a single
program is nearly impossible. This talk describes an approach to master this problem.

(12:00-13:00) Lunch break

(13:00-14:00) *Farbfeld - Rethinking image-formats*, Laslo Hunhold

This talk will discuss the deficiencies of the RGBA color space and
present the Farbfeld format to store images in a device independent
way using the Lab color space.
Additionally, an alternative to incorporated, namely imposed, image
compression is discussed, evaluating the advantages over other image
formats using different kinds of images.

(14:00-14:30) *Document processing*, Manu Raster

(14:30-15:00) Coffee/tea break

(15:00-16:00) *UTF-8 everywhere? Writing Unicode compliant software that sucks less*, Laslo Hunhold

This talk will discuss UTF-8 and its history, how and when you have to
deal with it and which challenges are faced along the way, evaluating
its advantages over other character encodings.
Besides more trivial problems like decoding and encoding, advanced
issues like string comparison, case conversion and normalization are
discussed, leading to the conclusion that the POSIX wchar-interfaces
are broken by design.
Using suckless principles, problems with the ICU libraries are discussed
and a midway drawn between total localization and minimalism,
presenting possible solutions.

-------

(16:00-17:45) Working on the projects with all brain power
