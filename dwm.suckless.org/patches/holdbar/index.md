holdbar
=======

Description
-----------
Dwm's built-in status bar is now only shown when HOLDKEY is pressed. In addition the bar will now overlay the display. This will work regardless of the topbar setting.
This is meant to be used with the bar off my default

Notes
-----
None of the togglebar code has been removed, although you might want to remove the togglebar binding in your config.def.h.
