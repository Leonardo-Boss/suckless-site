*"Inspired by the beauty of the arctic, the colors reflect the cold, yet harmonious world of ice and the colorfulness of the Aurora Borealis."* - [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

There are also many [ports](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports) for other programs like [vim](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/vim) and [tmux](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/tmux) to make the overall appearance coherent. I would recommend to use it in combination with the arc-theme for gtk (fits perfectly).

Check out the [selectioncolors](../selectioncolors/)-patch if you want that the colors which are used when text is selected are also nord-colors. The default behaviour of st is simply to reverse the fore- and background colors of each selected cell.
