        way using the Lab color space.
        Additionally, an alternative to incorporated, namely imposed, image
        compression is discussed, evaluating the advantages over other image
        formats using different kinds of images.

Talks
-----

(10:30-10:45) *Opening of day 2*, Anselm R Garbe

(10:45-11:30) *Simple Jabber - Divide And Conquer XMPP*, Jan Klemkow

        The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)1 is like the web. It is
        far too complex to be implemented in one program with the Unix philosophy in mind.
        But like the web, you have to deal with it. It is the only open
        and widely used instant messaging protocol on the internet.
        Its extensibility is the main reason that an implementation in a single
        program is nearly impossible. This talk describes an approach to master this problem.

(11:30-12:00) *Finite state document processing*, Manu Raster

        Mainstream XML processing techniques wastefully consume time
        and memory for example in file format conversions popularly
        known as 'save as â€¦'. In this talk we present a less
        wasteful method based on finite-state transducers.

(12:00-13:00) Lunch

(13:00-13:15) Conference fee collection

(13:15-14:15) *UTF-8 everywhere? Writing Unicode compliant software that sucks less*, Laslo Hunhold

        This talk will discuss UTF-8 and its history, how and when you have to
        deal with it and which challenges are faced along the way, evaluating
        its advantages over other character encodings.
        Besides more trivial problems like decoding and encoding, advanced
        issues like string comparison, case conversion and normalization are
        discussed, leading to the conclusion that the POSIX wchar-interfaces
        are broken by design.
        Using suckless principles, problems with the ICU libraries are discussed
        and a midway drawn between total localization and minimalism,
        presenting possible solutions.

(14:15-14:45) Coffee/Tea break

(14:45-15:00) *Formal conference talk closing*, Anselm R Garbe

(15:00-17:00) Hacking

(17:00-) TBD
