libgrapheme is an extremely simple library providing utilities for
properly handling perceived characters ('grapheme clusters') according to
the Unicode standard.

The goal of this project is to be a suckless and statically linkable
alternative to the existing bloated and complicated solutions (ICU,
libunistring, etc.), increasing the number of programs properly handling
Unicode strings.

Development
