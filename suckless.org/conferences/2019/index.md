### Machine Translation, Manu Raster

The topic I would like to present is "Machine Translation" and it is in
the spirit of Douglas Hofstadters destructive critique¹ and my own
critique of Franz-Josef Ochs² concepts of translation from a history of
science point of view. In comparison to the early beginnings (Bar-Hillel
1960 "The Present Status of Automatic Translation of Languages") little
progress has been made. In particular I will explain

- why engineers use intermediate languages (IL) and why they suck
  - analogies between code generation and literature translation
  - keywords: philologists and barbarians, the babelfish-device, binary-size sanity
- how translation fails on IL-level and surface level (destination language)
- what a good computer assisted translation tool for advanced users can
  achieve such as an Acme-based tool³

and present reproducable examples where Google Translate™ and its
epigones fail systematically.

### OpenBSD Supremacy, Laslo Hunhold

### Sierpinski on Flector, Gergely Bencsik, Tı́mea Fekete

168 hours long noise from sierpinski triangles

The topic of generative and low-complexity art is not new. Jürgen Schmidhuber identified low-complexity art as the
computer age verson of minimalism[1] in 1997, and drew up basic goals and rules about this genre in visual art. The
ideology of low-complexity art also usable in musical methodology with relevant rules and goals.

In this work we will describe a structural noise-music genre album and the low-complexity background of it. This
project is about a small C language stack that generates a 168 hours long music album into a large data blob that can be
separated to smaller chunks. The album, Sierpinski on Flector also uses a generation method[2] that is been presented by
Ville-Matias Heikkilä, known as byte-beat.
