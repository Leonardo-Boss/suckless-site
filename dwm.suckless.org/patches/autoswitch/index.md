autoswitch
============

Description
-----------

The **AutoSwitch** patch for the Dynamic Window Manager (dwm)
offers a convenient way to optimize your workflow.
It automatically switches between monocle and tiling modes after N windows are opened.
You can specify N in the configuration file, with 4 as the default,
but it can be customized to fit your preferences.

This patch is inspired by a Reddit post [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/suckless/comments/1fk6ogn/dwm_auto_monocle_mode/).
