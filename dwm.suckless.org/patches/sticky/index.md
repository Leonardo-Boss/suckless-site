sticky
======

Description
-----------
Press `MODKEY+s` (default) to make a client 'sticky'. A sticky client is visible
on all tags. This is similar to setting the client's `tags` to all 1's, but with
the ability to easily return it to its original tag by toggling it off by
pressing `MODKEY+s` again.
