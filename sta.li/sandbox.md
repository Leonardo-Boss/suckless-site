Sandbox
=======

Ideas that could be worthwhile for the development of sta.li
will be collected here. Just add them using the known ways
of suckless wiki editing.

There are 'principles', 'ideas' and 'quick ideas'. Basic sanity
should be used to determine where to put your text.

Principles
----------

* each executable is statically linked

Ideas
-----

* maybe a different format to ELF
* kernel is a monolithic Linux kernel
* system loader is lilo
* no initrd
* make the whole system a ramdisk
* a basic initsystem
* updating is rsyncing the build files and rebuilding what is needed

Quick Ideas
-----------
