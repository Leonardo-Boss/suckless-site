Vim Browse
==========
The vim-browse patch offers the possibility to move through the terminal history-buffer, search for strings using VIM-like motions, operations and quantifiers. It overlays the screen with highlighted search results and displays the current operation / motions / search string in the bottom right corner. The patch operates on top of the [history-patch](https://github.com/juliusHuelsmann/st-history-vim), which comes with a set of optional features that can be compiled-in as separate patches. Please [leave a star](https://github.com/juliusHuelsmann/st-history-vim).

Default Behavior:
-----------------
A more detailed overview on the commands can be found [here](https://github.com/juliusHuelsmann/st-history-vim/wiki/Vim-browse-manual) and in the file `normalMode.c`.

**Enter / Leave different modes**:

- `Alt`+`c`: Enter normal mode
- `[esc]`/`[enter]`/`i`: Enter insert mode or abort current operation / motion

**Operations:**

- `y`/`v`/`V`: enter `yank` / `visual` / `visual line` mode.

**Motions:**

- `k`, `j`, `h`, `l`, `H`, `M`, `L`, `0`, `$`, `n`, `N`, `w`, `W`, `b`, `B`, `e`, `E`, `Ctrl u`,
  `Ctrl d`, `Ctrl b`, `Ctrl f`, `y`, `?`, `/` like in Vim
- `.` re-execute last command (which is shown in the overlay)
- Infixes `i`, `a`: like in Vim, in conjunction with an operation and motion or pre-defined search char `(){}[]<>"'` (`yiw`, `vi[`, ...)
- `[0-9]` Quantifiers
- `[backspace]` erase last quantifier / letter in search and command string
- `r` manual repaint
- `K`, `J` Scroll buffer up / down
- `s`, `S` toggle [once] `MODE_ALTSCREEN`
- `G`, `g` move the history cursor to the current insert position / offset
- `t` toggle rectangle / normal selection mode
- `Ctrl h` hide overlay
- Custom commands can be defined in the configuration files (see `nmKeys`)

Patching and customization
--------------------------
The VIM patch performs changes in the `config.def.h` file, which need to be manually merged into a pre-existing custom `config.h` file. The following variables can be adapted from the defaults defined in `config.def.h`:
- `buffSize`: Size of the buffer history in lines
- `highlightBg` `highlightFg`: Background / Foreground color of search results
- `currentBg`: Background color used in order to highlight the current history cursor via a cross
- `nmKeys`: custom commands (= sequence of operations/motion), the first character is the key to be used in order to execute the sequence of operations / motions.
- `styleSearch` style of the search string overlay
- `style` styles of the command string overlay depending on the currently active operation ([`yank`, `visual`, `visualLine`, `no operation`]).
