dmenu_run with command history
==============================

A self-contained alternative to dmenu_run which also handles history.

History is saved in a file in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`, with fallback to a dot
file in `$HOME`. Change as necessary.

In addition to the above, dmenu_run_history will launch each entry
immediately on `Ctrl-Return` (multiselect).

The script can be used with the 4.6 version of dmenu.
