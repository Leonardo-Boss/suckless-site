Cool Daemons
============

This page is dedicated to Daemons that are related to the UNIX philosophy (but
don't really belong into the cool programs section which is about programs
which work well with dwm).

Web Servers
-----------
* [Nostromo](http://www.nazgul.ch/dev_nostromo.html)
* [thttpd](http://acme.com/software/thttpd/) - Outperforms many bigger httpds. Old, still works very well!
* [mini_httpd](http://acme.com/software/mini_httpd/) - By the thttpd developers. Even smaller subset of thttpd with support for .htpasswd, CGI, dirlisting, HTTP errors and SSL, nothing more or less than that.
* See also: our very own [quark](http://hg.suckless.org/quark/) which has not yet been released

Gopher Servers
--------------

* [geomyidae](http://www.r-36.net/src/geomyidae/) - small gopher-daemon written by 20h
