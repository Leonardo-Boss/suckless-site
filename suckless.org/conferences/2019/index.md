suckless conference 2019, Bad Liebenzell, Germany
=================================================

slcon6 will be held in Bad Liebenzell, Baden-Württemberg in Germany on
2019-10-(04-06).

Call for Papers
---------------

There will be regular talk sessions this year and we are calling for
optional talk proposals of around 30-60 minutes covering either
technological or philosophical topics (rants are welcome as well). Each
proposal should contain

* the name of the author
* an abstract written in English
* presumably reference links to related ideas or topics

and be sent to [admins@suckless.org](mailto:admins@suckless.org)
_until 2019-06-30_. We don't expect a paper or slide set prior to the
conference! If you can not attend on a certain day, please add a note
about it so we can fine-tune the schedule accordingly.

Conference Registration
-----------------------

The accommodation fee will be between 95-150€ and includes everything.
It will be due upon reservation confirmation.
Please contact us if and why you want to request sponsorship for the
accomodation; nobody should be left out for financial reasons.

In order to be able to arrange the conference properly, we also kindly
ask all of you who want to attend the event to _register until
2019-09-01_ by sending a mail to
[admins@suckless.org](mailto:admins@suckless.org)
with your name and clear message that you will definitely attend.
Places are limited (!) and secured on a first mail basis. We will inform
all successful registrants within 2 weeks after receiving their
mail.

We also believe that it would be a good idea to arrange your travel
already, if you plan to attend. We recommend arrival on 2019-10-04 at
noon and departure on 2019-10-06 evening.
The closest international airport is Stuttgart, Germany. Bad Liebenzell
is a 40 minute trip from Stuttgart airport and well-accessible by train.

Members of the suckless.org e.V. are invited to attend our annual
Mitgliederversammlung (members meeting) on 2019-10-05 evening at the
venue (the exact location will be communicated later).

We are looking forward to your talk proposals and registration requests!
