	GRAPHEME_IS_CHARACTER_BREAK(3)			      Library Functions Manual
	
	NAME
	     grapheme_is_character_break â€“ test for a grapheme cluster break between
	     two codepoints
	
	SYNOPSIS
	     #include <grapheme.h>
	
	     size_t
	     grapheme_is_character_break(uint_least32_t cp1, uint_least32_t cp2,
		 uint_least16_t *state);
	
	DESCRIPTION
	     The grapheme_is_character_break() function determines if there is a
	     grapheme cluster break (see libgrapheme(7)) between the two codepoints
	     cp1 and cp2.  By specification this decision depends on a state that can
	     at most be completely reset after detecting a break and must be reset
	     every time one deviates from sequential processing.
	
	     If state is NULL grapheme_is_character_break() behaves as if it was
	     called with a fully reset state.
	
	RETURN VALUES
	     The grapheme_is_character_break() function returns true if there is a
	     grapheme cluster break between the codepoints cp1 and cp2 and false if
	     there is not.
