Scripts and snippets
====================

Here, you can find all sorts of code snippets and plugins for the various
wmiircs available for wmii. Please choose your language to the left. And
please feel free to [contribute your own][1]! You'll just need a copy of
[Mercurial][2] and a text editor. Arcane as this may seem, it's the best way
we've found to cut down on spam and to keep the vast majority of our users
happy.
