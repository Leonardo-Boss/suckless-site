selectioncolors
===============

Description
-----------

This patch adds the two settings *selectionfg* and *selectionbg* to
config.def.h. Those define the fore- and background colors which are
used when text on the screen is selected with the mouse.
This removes the default behaviour which would simply reverse the colors.
