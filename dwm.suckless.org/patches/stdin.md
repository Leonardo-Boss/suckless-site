STDIN
=====

Description
-----------

This backports dwm's old behaviour found in pre-5.3 releases to read the status
text from stdin. It's a matter of personal preference, adds a few LOC, is less
prone to freezing (in my experience) and included here for the sake of
completeness.

This was originally part of dwm-5.2 and written by Anselm R. Garbe,
but the one to blame for the backport is Moritz Wilhelmy, who can be reached by
writing a mail to moritz plus dwm at wzff dot de.
