I like to move clients between different tabbed sessions. When moving clients 
between tabbed windows, problems can arise. Sometimes, the previous tabbed 
session retains control, affecting key bindings in the new session. This issue 
also persists if a client is simply unmanaged, as key bindings remain active 
outside of the tabbed session. This problem can be resolved by ungrabbing the 
keys when a client is being unmanaged.
