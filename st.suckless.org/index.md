st is a simple terminal implementation for X.

What is wrong with xterm?
-------------------------
xterm is bloated and unmaintainable. Here's an excerpt from the README:

					Abandon All Hope, Ye Who Enter Here
		
		
	This is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.	It was one of
	the first "serious" programs ported, and still has a lot of historical baggage.
	Ideally, there would be a general tty widget and then vt102 and tek4014 
	subwidgets so that they could be used in other programs.  We are trying to 
	clean things up as we go, but there is still a lot of work to do.

Needless to say things have *not* changed, it's still ugly.
It has over 65K lines of code and emulates obscure and obsolete terminals 
you will [never need](http://www.science.uva.nl/museum/tek4014.html). 
The popular alternative, rxvt has *only* 32K lines of code. This is just
too much for something as simple as a terminal emulator; it's yet another
example of code complexity.

Current state
-------------
See the "[goals](http://st.suckless.org/goals)" section for a list of features that will (or won't) be implemented.

* 256 colors
* most VT10/x/ escape sequences
* no multibyte encoding

Configuration
-------------

The configuration is done in `config.h` (like in dwm). You can define:

* TERM
* fonts
* default colors
* special key
* line drawing characters. The VT100 name is used as an index in the `gfx` array. From terminfo(5):


	Line Graphics
	       Many  terminals have alternate character sets useful for forms-drawing.
	       Terminfo and curses build in support for the  drawing  characters  sup-
	       ported  by  the VT100, with some characters from the AT&T 4410v1 added.
	       This alternate character set may be specified by the acsc capability.

Common Problems
---------------

### 1. *random program* complains that st is unknown/not recognised/unsupported/whatever!
It means that st doesn't have any terminfo entry on your
system. Chances are you did not `make install`.  If you just want to
test it without installing it, you can manualy run `tic st.info` in st
dir. It will compile st.info into a fully working local terminfo
description in `~/.terminfo`. You can delete it when you're done.

### 2. Nothing works, and nothing is said about an unknown terminal!
* Some programs just assume they're running in xterm i.e. they don't rely on terminfo. What you see is the current state of the "xterm compliance".
* Some programs don't complain about the lacking st description and default to another terminal. In that case see 1.
