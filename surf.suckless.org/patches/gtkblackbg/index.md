GTK Black Background
====================

Description
-----------
Add a black background to the GTK window and make this visible by hiding the background of the WebKit view. This effectively eliminates the momentary white screen that shows after launching `surf`.

Combine this patch with darkmode CSS styles and/or an enabled `DarkMode` setting in `config.h` for a completely darkened surfing experience.
