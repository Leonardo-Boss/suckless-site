Tagshift
========
Adds keybinds for circularly shifting back and forth viewed tags or a client's tags. 
This is an alternative to the [adjacenttag patch](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/adjacenttag/) that allows 
for shifting forward and back all viewed tags, rather than just one. This is by default bound to 
mod + left and mod + right for shifting the viewed tags, mod + shift + left and mod + shift + right 
for shifting a client's tags.

For example, shifting the tags 2 and 3 to the right by one would change them to 3 and 4, and 
if a client's tags were set to 1 and 9, shifting them to the left by one would change them to 8 and 9.
