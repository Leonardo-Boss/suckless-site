exresize
========

Description
-----------

This allows the user to change size and placement of floating windows using only
the keyboard. It also allows for temporary vertical and horizontal extension of
windows similar to other WMs fill command. This patch is inspired by
[maximize](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/maximize) and
[moveresize](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/moveresize) but fixes a lot of
problems I had with those patches. It also includes the functionality of
[save floats](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/save_floats) judging by it's
description.
