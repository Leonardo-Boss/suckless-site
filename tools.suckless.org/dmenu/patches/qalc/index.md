qalc
==================
This patch adds an additional flag to dmenu, -C, which turns the app into a calculator, Ã  la rofi-calc. The feedback is very smooth and the result of the equation is updated every time a key is pressed. This patch requires the *qalculate* CLI tool to be installed in /usr/bin/. For more info on its capabilities and syntax, visit <https://qalculate.github.io/>.
