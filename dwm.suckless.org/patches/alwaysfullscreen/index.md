alwaysfullscreen
================

Description
-----------
Do not allow the focus to drift from the active fullscreen client when using
focusstack().

This change was merged into dwm itself in
[67d76bdc6810](https://git.suckless.org/dwm/commit/67d76bdc68102df976177de351f65329d8683064.html),
so this patch is only needed if you're using a tree from before that.
