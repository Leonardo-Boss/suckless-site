inverted low contrast style
===========================

Filter based solutions for those who like it dark (mostly, on dark sites
efect is oposite), but don't like acid-trippy images and colors. Works
reasonably smooth, unless there are lots of images.

dark css
--------

    html, img { -webkit-filter: invert(95%) hue-rotate(180deg); }
