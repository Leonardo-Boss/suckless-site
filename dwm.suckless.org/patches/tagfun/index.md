tagfun
======

Description
-----------
This patch allows you to bind functions to your tags, invoked with mouse middle button.

Recommendations
---------------
This patch tries to improve mouse usability. By default, first tag binds to kill current client,
second tag spawn terminal. Leave the kill client function alone (or bind to else where),
and add some defaults apps to your tags.

It is recommended to use rofi, combined with launchpad theme, this will provied you
almost fully functional mouse experience.
