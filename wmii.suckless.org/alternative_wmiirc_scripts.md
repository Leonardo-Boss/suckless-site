Alternative `wmiirc` scripts
============================

wmii was designed to be scriptable in any language you choose. Here are some
alternative `wmiirc` scripts, in various languages. Feel free to add your own,
with a short description of its features and its language.


sunaku's Ruby `wmiirc`
---------------------

[sunaku's Ruby `wmiirc`](http://github.com/sunaku/wmiirc)
manipulates wmii (in the Ruby way) through 
[the Rumai library](http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/)
which speaks directly to wmii via the 9P2000 protocol
and features an [interactive Ruby shell for live
entertainment](http://snk.tuxfamily.org/lib/rumai/#Tutorial).

This `wmiirc` features:

* Logging and crash recovery.
* DSL for events, keystrokes, and actions in wmii.
* Manipulating *multiple* clients simultaneously.
* Automatic client arrangement (LarsWM, grid, diamond, etc.)
* Zooming clients to a temporary workspace.
* Closing all clients before exiting wmii.
* [Music Player Daemon (MPD)](http://mpd.wikia.com) integration.
* Shortcuts optimized for [Dvorak layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) on a [Kinesis keyboard](http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm).
* And [so much more...](http://snk.tuxfamily.org/web/2006-07-01-wmii-3-1-configuration-in-ruby.html)

All of this can be configured to suit your needs, of course.
