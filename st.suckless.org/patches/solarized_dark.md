Solarized
=========

Description
-----------

This patch applies the "solarized" color scheme for xterm (16 colors),
found in [1] in the file "xresources-colors-solarized/Xresources"
on the color scheme's website [2].

Notes
-----

There exists a more extensive patch [3], which provides a
dark and a light scheme.

I'll provide more information when I've looked into it myself.

Example
