amixer-integration
==================

Description
-----------
This patch allows volume to be increased or decreased using the volume buttons on a Laptop. This only works with amixer and your device would need to have amixer installed as well as dedicated volume buttons to work properly.

Please contact me via email if you want to suggest an update or fix any bugs.
