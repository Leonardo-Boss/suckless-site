emptyview

Description
-----------
I like my wallpapers. Also i found it kind of unintuitive that you can not toggle the last tag out of view. So i created a patch to allow no tag at all to be selected.

With this patch, dwm will start with no tag selected. When you start a client with no tag rule and no tag selected, it gets opened in the first tag.
