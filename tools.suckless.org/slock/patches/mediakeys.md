Mediakeys
=========

Description
-----------
This patch allows using the following keys to be used while the screen is
locked:
	- XF86AudioLowerVolume
	- XF86AudioMute
	- XF86AudioRaiseVolume
	- XF86AudioPlay
	- XF86AudioStop
	- XF86AudioPrev
	- XF86AudioNext

I don't want to unlock the screen just in order to skip the current song
or raise the volume, that's all there is to it.
