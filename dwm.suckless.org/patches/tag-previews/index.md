tag previews
================

Description
-----------
Allows you to see the contents of an already viewed tag. So a more accurate
description would be to re-view a tag. This patch is extracted from
https://github.com/siduck76/chadwm. Keep in mind that this uses Imlib2, which
on the diff is already put on.
