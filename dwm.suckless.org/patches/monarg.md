Monitor by Argument for dmenu
=============================

Description
-----------

Since dmenu was made to accept additional command line argument with
[dmenu-4.5-monarg.diff](http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/monarg) to
specify the monitor where dmenu is to be started. Works well with my monarg
patch for dwm.
