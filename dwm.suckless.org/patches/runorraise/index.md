runorraise
==========

Description
-----------
This patch adds a equivalent to stumpwm's [run-or-raise] action for DWM.

The idea is to have each frequently-used application one key combination away at all times, irrespective of which workspace it is on,
or how recently it has been used, or even whether itâ€™s running or not.

Usage
-----

1 In your config.h:

    static const char *emacs[] = { "emacsclient", "-c", NULL, NULL, "Emacs" };
    static const char *browser[] = { "firefox", NULL, NULL, NULL, "Firefox" };

2 In your keybindings add something like:

    { Modkey,                       XK_e,      runorraise,     {.v = emacs } },
    { Modkey,                       XK_f,      runorraise,     {.v = firefox } },
