quickcancel
===========

Description
-----------

Allow slock to be cancelled by simple mouse movement within the
first 3 seconds after starting.

This is useful if you forgot to disable `xautolock` during
an activity that requires no input (e.g. reading text, watching video).

Notes
-----

The number of seconds while the lock can be cancelled is configured
in `config.h` via the `timetocancel` option.
