XMMS-LIKE PATTERN MATCHING
==========================

This patch allows the user to match strings in several pieces.
For example to type:  

	 dme atc
  
could match  

	 http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/

 in someone's bookmarks file.

This feature is enabled by -xs command line flag, it can be useful to ease the matching on huge strings.
