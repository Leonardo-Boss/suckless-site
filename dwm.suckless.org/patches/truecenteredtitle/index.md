truecenteredtitle
=================

Description
-----------
Center the title with proportion to the area that the title has, unlike the
[other center title](../centretitle) patch that center proportion to the screen size width
(`m->ww`), which on smaller monitors doesn't get the effect.

If the title name is to long (title area too small for the title string) it
will back up to the default behaviour, which is to truncate the title.
