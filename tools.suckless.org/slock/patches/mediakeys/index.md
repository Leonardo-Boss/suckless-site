Mediakeys
=========

Description
-----------
This patch allows using the following keys to be used while the screen is
locked:

- XF86AudioLowerVolume
- XF86AudioMute
- XF86AudioRaiseVolume
- XF86AudioPlay
- XF86AudioStop
- XF86AudioPrev
- XF86AudioNext

I don't want to unlock the screen just in order to skip the current song or
raise the volume, that's all there is to it.
