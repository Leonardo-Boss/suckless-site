(11:15-12:00) *suckless core - A suckless userspace foundation*, Laslo Hunhold, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-01-frign-suckless_core.mts))

> This talk will focus on recent developments in the suckless core
  programs, the design and motivation behind them and which issues were
  faced along the way, including ditching POSIX in some places in favor of
  suckless design principles and consistency.
  Current issues and future plans will be discussed in the last part.

(12.00-12:45) *stali 2015*, Anselm R Garbe, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-02-arg-stali_2015.mts))

(13:45-14:30) *new suckless tools*, Anselm R Garbe, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-03-arg-new_suckless_tools.mts))

(14:30-15:30) *Farbfeld - Rethinking image-formats*, Laslo Hunhold, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-04-frign-farbfeld.mts))

> This talk will discuss the deficiencies of the RGBA color space and
  present the Farbfeld format to store images in a device independent
  way using the Lab color space.
  Additionally, an alternative to incorporated, namely imposed, image
  compression is discussed, evaluating the advantages over other image
  formats using different kinds of images.

(15:30-16:00) Coffee/Tea break

Talks
-----

(10:30-10:45) *Opening of day 2*, Anselm R Garbe, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-06-arg-opening_of_day_2.mts))

(10:45-11:30) *Simple Jabber - Divide And Conquer XMPP*, Jan Klemkow, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-07-klenkow-simple_jabber.mts))

> The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol ([XMPP][2]) is like the web. It is
  far too complex to be implemented in one program with the Unix philosophy in mind.
  But like the web, you have to deal with it. It is the only open
  and widely used instant messaging protocol on the internet.
  Its extensibility is the main reason that an implementation in a single
  program is nearly impossible. This talk describes an approach to master this problem.

(11:30-12:00) *Finite state document processing*, Manu Raster, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-08-raster-finite_state_document_processing.mts))

> Mainstream XML processing techniques wastefully consume time
  and memory for example in file format conversions popularly
  known as 'save as â€¦'. In this talk we present a less
  wasteful method based on finite-state transducers.

(12:00-13:00) Lunch

(13:00-13:15) Conference fee collection

(13:15-14:15) *UTF-8 everywhere? Writing Unicode compliant software that sucks less*, Laslo Hunhold, ([video](http://dl.sta.li/slcon/2015/slcon-2015-09-frign-utf-8_everywhere.mts))

> This talk will discuss UTF-8 and its history, how and when you have to
  deal with it and which challenges are faced along the way, evaluating
  its advantages over other character encodings.
  Besides more trivial problems like decoding and encoding, advanced
  issues like string comparison, case conversion and normalization are
  discussed, leading to the conclusion that the POSIX wchar-interfaces
  are broken by design.
  Using suckless principles, problems with the ICU libraries are discussed
  and a midway drawn between total localization and minimalism,
  presenting possible solutions.

(14:15-14:45) Coffee/Tea break

(14:45-15:00) *Formal conference talk closing*, Anselm R Garbe

(15:00-17:00) Hacking

(17:00-) TBD
