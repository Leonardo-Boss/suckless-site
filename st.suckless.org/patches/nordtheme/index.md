Description

*Inspired by the beauty of the arctic, the colors reflect the cold, yet harmonious world of ice and the colorfulness of the Aurora Borealis.* - [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

There are also many [ports](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports) for other programs like [vim](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/vim) and [tmux](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/tmux) to make the overall appearance coherent.
I would recommend to use it in combination with the arc-theme for gtk (fits perfectly).
