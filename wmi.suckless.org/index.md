WMI
===
wmi was the initial project which became popular, though [wmii](/wmii/) is the
successor of wmi. The last release of wmi happened back in 2004. There are still
some occasional users of wmi. If you like to check how the good old days felt,
check it out, though its code sucks more unfortunately than our more
recent projects.

Download
--------
You can download the historic copy of
[wmi-10](http://code.suckless.org/dl/misc/wmi-10.tar.gz). Unfortunately there
is no associated repository anymore. There used to be a subversion repository
in the older days.

Build
-----
In order to build wmi-10 on more recent systems than they were back 4
years ago, you will need to apply [this
patch](/wmi/wmi-10_compile_fixes.diff) by Sergey Dolgov.

Issues
------
If you want to contact the author of wmi, use his proper email address
[garbeam@gmail.com](mailto:garbeam@gmail.com) -- the email address presented in
the wmi-10 source isn't valid anymore.
