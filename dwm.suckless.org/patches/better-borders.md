better borders
==============

Description
-----------

Like [Ebersbach's patch](http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder), this patch
removes the border when there is only one window visible, but this patch does
should automatically work with most other custom layouts with no additiona
layout-specific changes.

Thanks to Alesandar Metodiev for reporting a bug that lead to the patch being
rewritten.
