================

Description
-----------
Border width, colours, and fonts config to mimic Windows 3.1 aesthetics.
You must have installed [Fixedsys Excelsior font](https://github.com/kika/fixedsys) by Darien Valentine.

If you use any GTK/Qt application, [B00merang Project theme](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-3.11) is a nice addition.
For icons you could use [Chicago95](https://github.com/Elbullazul/Chicago95) by Elbullazu, but I prefer [quadpixels's Classic95 edit](https://github.com/quadpixels/classic95).

Last but not least, [Hackneyed cursor](https://gitlab.com/Enthymeme/hackneyed-x11-cursors/) by Richard Ferreira is almost a must!
